            <h2 class="title">About the academy</h2>
            <p>The Sky Women in Technology Academy aims to provide a unique and supportive environment in which women with little or no previous technical experience can learn some of the skills necessary to begin a career in Software Development. Sky recognises the significant lack of gender diversity in the technology industry, and we believe that encouraging capable, talented women into technical roles can bring enormous benefits, both to the women themselves, and also to the teams and companies they end up working with. By introducing more women into the pool of talent we are able to recruit from, we hope to see increased diversity in the top engineering talent we end up recruiting.</p>
            <p>The Academy provides beginner level training courses which aim to give people the skills necessary to apply for entry level jobs in Software Engineering. By the end of one of our courses you will be equipped with the technical skills you need to start building websites and applications, have an understanding and some experience of Agile ways of working in software engineering, and you will have built your very own original software project as part of a team. We hope you will leave the Academy inspired and empowered, and in a strong position to apply for Junior Software Developer roles should you wish to.</p>

                <h2>What is a Software Engineer?</h2>
                <p>A software developer creates computer software to solve real world problems. They work as part of a team of people with various different areas of expertise, working closely together to bring a project to life and deliver a high quality software product.</p>

                    <h2>Communication</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Forget the old stereotype of isolated lone coders hacking away in the dark - modern software engineering is all about teamwork. You’ll need to be comfortable talking tech with other developers, as well as with non-technical team members and stakeholders. As part of a team of equals (we don’t have hierarchies within our teams), you’ll be part of key decision making discussions, and you’ll need to be comfortable getting your opinion heard and listening to the opinions of others.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>You’ll need to be able to translate what you want to achieve into logical commands that the computer can interpret. However, this doesn’t mean that you need to have been top in your maths class or amazing at spreadsheets. If you can do a sudoku, that’s about all the maths you really need to be a software developer!</p>
